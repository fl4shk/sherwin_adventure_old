# Block System
1. Block behavior type will be implemented from the beginning this time.
More interesting block behavior types than I had before will be made to
exist.
2. Interaction between sprites and blocks will be made simpler.  I am not
sure how yet.
3. Getting strongly hit may cause a block to change what type of block it
is, depending on what type of block it was to start with.
