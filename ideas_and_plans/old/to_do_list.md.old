To-Do List
==========
1.  Use the snow golem as an enemy for testing out player knockback,
damage, and invincibility frames.  Perhaps I won't have knockback, though.
2.  Overworld/level select system, and another temporary level.
3.  Regular exits from levels.
4.  Secret exits from levels.
5.  Make it so that sublevels have **invisible** vertical walls at the
boundaries that *only* prevent Sherwin from "escaping" the sublevel.
